# TravelTime - Front-End Developer Test Assignment
### Introduction

This is a Front-End Developer Test Assignment. This assignment aims to build a minimal receipt tracking application using any programming languages or frameworks. </br></br> The completed project prototype can be viewed by following this link: https://6320ac2360c6c9116d543719--euphonious-nasturtium-60a932.netlify.app/

Technologies used: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap & Vue.js Frameworks

```
Some Notes: This project was completed in the quick phase. Therefore, it still has some limitations that could be tackled in further development. For example, from the code perspective, logic and HTML markup currently is in one file; however, in the future, this project could use reusable dynamic components - for example, adding a new receipt component to the view. This would make code more readable and simpler to manage if the project grows. However, for this demonstration purposes, this should be fine :)   

```
